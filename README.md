# Flutter_Counter

Flutter Counter is an example or simple project in application development using Flutter, which aims to demonstrate the basic concepts in creating Flutter applications. Typically, Flutter Counter is an application that has “Add” and “Decrease” buttons that are used to increase or decrease the value displayed on the screen.

In its implementation, Flutter Counter usually consists of:

1. Text or widget that displays values that can change. This value can be a number or text, depending on the application's needs.
2. The "Add" button will increase the value displayed when pressed.
3. "Less" button which will decrease the displayed value when pressed.

This is a simple example of learning Flutter, which helps developers understand basic concepts such as state management, widgets, and event handling in Flutter.
